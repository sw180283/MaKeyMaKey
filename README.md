##Market Research
To be able to produce a controller, research of existing products is necessary to find out how other production companies and developers have designed their user interface to be compatible with their game choice.

##Ergonomics
To make a controller suited for gaming, the ergonomics of the controller has to be appropriate for people holding it for a long time. If your controller starts to make the player's hands cramp then it's a bad controller and the game won't be played. Another issue with ergonomics is that gamers vary in sizes and so do their hands. To make a tailored controller to fit a large handed man can't fit in the hands of a small handed woman. Therefore an average is taken to make sure that the consumers hand of varying sizes (within reason) are able to reach the buttons and hold the controller without difficulty.

##For My Controller Design
Companies have funded ergonomic design study for years and have been shown to mostly follow a simple controller design (xbox, playstation, etc). The ability to grip the controller with two hands gives stability and dual control over the controller. With the ability to control two characters in this game, this idea would be useful in not only providing a stable base to dual control characters, but also provide an expected experience when holding the controller.

##Complexity
If a controller is too complex, it can reduce the number of users and the game it is intended for is less. For a game with a casual gamer target audience, a controller with multiple combination buttons can cause frustration with the uses. However, for a veteran player then the complexity is a challenge and the skill of the player improves their usability.

##For My Controller Design
I think the target audience for this game is for young audiences, so the controller should be kept simple. This means that minimal buttons and recognisable layout should be used to give the user an expected outcome when using the controller.

##Connectivity
Most controllers are started to become wireless however some wired controllers still exist. For wireless controllers, it reduces the clutter of storage and also improves the mobility and engagement in the game. However, rechargable or non-rechargable batteries are required and a sync process is needed. There can be other issues with wireless if there require a direct line of sight to a sensor to work if there are obsticles in the way.

##For My Controller Design
My controller has to be wired, however if this was a full production, I could suggest that my prototype would have a wireless connection if I could show evidence of how this could be stored.

##Visual and Audio
Other controllers are through visual and audio sensors, which change the engagement with the player. Depending on the type of game this can improve or decrease this. For a dance game, a visual sensor can make the game seem more intuitive and suited than a standard controller. With singing games, audio sensors do something that a standard controller cannot and actual requires the gamer to user their voice to sing instead of a button. This has also been incorporated into commands in addition to standard controllers such as the Xbox One headset which allows uses to start games, pause movies and shutdown the console with voice control.

##Game Choice from BA
The game my controller is designed for is the team 9 Castle Guillotine game. The controls required are:
- WASD for player 1 movement
- Arrow keys for player 2 movement
- Mouse control
- Left click
- Space player 1 jump
- RightCtrl player 2 jump
- E for interact key
- R for combine players

##Research for Target Audience
The intended audience of this game appears to be for children, as the art style is cartoony with no blood and basic controls. Therefore, I should aim to engage the players with a controller that engages the player with a design that makes controls easy to handle but also functional.  

When looking at what games kids play, they play games the same way as older audiences do. Xbox and Playstation all support the same type of controller design and young audiences have managed to use these just as well. After the first sprint review, I decided to do more research into the design of shaped controllers as I thought this would make the controller novel while still being functional in design.

The guitar shows how its functionality is simple yet engaging in its design. With only a few buttons it still is complex enough to appear creative and simple enough for a child to play. Also, if a child knows how to hold a guitar or has seen one held, they instantly hold the controller correctly.

##For My Controller Design
I want to use this for my design where I take inspiration from xbox and playstation analogs which make children instantly know how to hold it. In addition, the bone shape is novel to the game design as the focus is around comical ogres/trolls/goblins/monsters which would likely carry a club/bone.

##Inital Design
For my design, I want to use two/three anolog stigs: one for player 1 movement and one for player 2 movement with a third anology stick for the mouse control. However if it's possible to use a button and change the function of the player 2 movement anolog for the mouse control.

#First Sprint Controller Review
In the first sprint review, I made progress making my controller, however the novelty of the design was questioned. I wanted to think of a way to make my controller more engaging while still being functional as a controller.

#Second design for controller

After working on my controller, I have altered the shape to appear more novel to the game design. The game is focused on playing as an ogre/goblin/troll/beast so I thought that the shape of a bone was suited to this player. I also used electrical glue to make a prototype of the controller which is functional with the game (mouse, WASD, mouse, space).

#Second Sprint Controller Review
The second review gave us the opportunity to get feedback from our peers and lecturer as they could test our controlls while using a heuristic approach. From my first sprint plan, I have altered my design to appear more novel, while relating to the game. I was able to to explain the reasons behind this choice and why I thought this would engage the players more.

One of the most recommended improvements was to somehow contain the wires in a way that would appear less messy, but also attempt to use only the wires for circuitry instead of the crocodile clips. This is a difficult task as I am not allowed to solder or super glue the components together as the equipment is only on loan. This means that temporary tape can be used.

Another issue was that the controller should be smaller to make holding it easier. This was a prototype design choice as it meant that the wires would conflict. However, if I can alter the circuitry then I should be able to alter the controller dimensions.

#Final Prototype
For the final prototype I was able to alter the cicuirty to make the controller easy to handle while containing all the necessary wires. In a professional prototype, with more material, I would have soldered wires together to make the container for the wires/makeymakey much smaller. However, the equipment I used was all from around my house and I only bought the metal fold out pins.  
  
Materials used:
* Magnets (x5) from my house to act as analog sticks. Three magnets are behind the controller and make the outside magnets center while in position. The two outside magnets are used as the analogs however I ran out of magnets for the third analog.
* Metal fold out pins (83p) from shop used as buttons. They are used as buttons but also pins for the analog use.
* Aluminium foil from my house. Used as earth connection to users hand.
* Super glue and Tape from my house.
* Cardboard from my house.
* Makeymakey board and wires provided by lecturer.

I wanted to create a different holding position for players who wanted to the controller to be more novel, however this wasn't possible for the time left. I also didn't implement the E key as it appeared to have no in game function as collision was enough to do this action. Also I used the code from [SparkFun](https://github.com/sparkfun/MaKeyMaKey/blob/master/firmware/Arduino/makey_makey/settings.h) for changing the makemakey keys, as well as the [makeymakey remapping](http://www.makeymakey.com/remap_classic/index.html) website to change some keys. However, I didn't implement the jump for the second character as the uncombine R key did the same thing and had an issue with the Arudino IDE port control.

#Code Snippet For Keys

  // top side of the makey makey board
 
  KEY_UP_ARROW,      // up arrow pad move character 2 forward

  'd',                // pin D2 move character 1 right
  'r',                // pin D1 combine the two characters
  'g',                // pin D0 button has no use
  
  // female header on the back right side
  
  MOUSE_MOVE_UP,      // pin A5 move mouse up screen
  MOUSE_MOVE_DOWN,    // pin A4 move mouse down screen
  MOUSE_MOVE_LEFT,    // pin A3 move mouse left screen
  MOUSE_MOVE_RIGHT,   // pin A2 move mouse right screen
  MOUSE_LEFT,         // pin A1 left click mouse select
